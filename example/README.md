# demo Pushup app

This directory contains an example demo of a Pushup app that shows off various
Pushup features and models how to write Pushup syntax.

To run it, install the main Pushup app, and type:

```
pushup run -build-pkg github.com/AdHocRandD/pushup/example/build
```

(Note that the need to type `-build-pkg ...` is temporary and will go
away soon.)
